# AK-AHMD Hand Gesture Arduino Controller

## Project Overview

The **AK-AHMD Hand Gesture Arduino Controller** is an intelligent real-time system that bridges computer vision and physical hardware control. Developed by the AK & AHMD team, this project enables users to control Arduino-connected devices using simple hand gestures captured through a webcam.

## What It Does

**üñêÔ∏è Gesture Recognition**: Uses advanced MediaPipe technology to detect and count fingers (0-5) in real-time through your camera.

**‚ö° Instant Communication**: Sends finger count data from Python application to Arduino via serial communication.

**üí° Visual Feedback**: Controls 5 LEDs connected to Arduino pins, where each LED represents one finger - providing immediate physical feedback for your gestures.

**üéØ Special Features**: 
- **Celebration Mode**: When 5 fingers are detected, triggers a special LED animation sequence
- **Reset Mode**: When no fingers are detected, turns off all LEDs
- **System Monitoring**: Built-in heartbeat system ensures reliable operation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Python with OpenCV for camera interface and MediaPipe for hand detection
- **Backend**: Arduino firmware with optimized LED control and serial communication
- **Configuration**: JSON-based settings for easy customization
- **Communication**: Serial protocol for real-time data transfer

## Key Benefits

- **Contactless Control**: Operate devices without physical touch
- **Real-time Response**: Instant feedback with minimal latency
- **Easy Setup**: Plug-and-play configuration with automatic device detection
- **Expandable**: Framework can be extended to control servos, motors, or other Arduino-compatible devices
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Perfect For
